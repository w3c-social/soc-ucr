        <h3>Adding Recommendations to Bestpoke Software</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> James maintains an application for managing architectural designs
          </li>
          <li> Maggie, a senior architect would like to recommend many of the better designs
          </li>
          <li> James uses an existing liking service which allows him to post any recommendations, to provide this
          </li>
          <li> This service also allows James to present existing likes for the design in question
          </li>
          <li> Maggie gets to like specific designs, and her followers see these as do viewers of these designs
          </li>
          <li> James achieves this with a simple inclusion on the associated web page, but could have chosen a more detailed integration if greater control was needed over the user interface
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Adding Comments to Bestpoke Software</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Maria, an IT Architect, has been tasked with encouraging better collaboration on the development of her companies Industrial Processes
          </li>
          <li> As these processes are tightly controlled (though generally visible) an associated discussion and evangelisation capability is required
          </li>
          <li> Maria integrates with an existing comment capability to store and retrieve comments rather than redeveloping
          </li>
          <li> May-Ling sees the comment area with the Processes and suggests changes, as she herself does not have rights to update
          </li>
          <li> The process owner gets a notification that someone has commented on this Process
          </li>
          <li> Followers of both the Process owner and May-Ling will see this comment event
          </li>
          <li> Maria achieves this with a simple inclusion on the associated web page, but could have chosen a more detailed integration if greater control was needed over the user interface 
          </li>
